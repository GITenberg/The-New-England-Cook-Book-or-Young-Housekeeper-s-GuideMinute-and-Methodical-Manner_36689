<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="decshort" />

<p>The writer deems that no apology need be offered for adding another to
the long list of works on the truly interesting, if not noble science of
gastronomy, provided she has accomplished the desirable object of
producing a work that will commend itself to all persons of true taste;
that is to say, those whose taste has not been vitiated by a mode of
living contrary to her own. She has made that her aim, and although not
an Ude or Kitchener, she does profess to have sufficient knowledge of
the occult science, if properly imparted, to enlighten those not versed
in culinary lore.</p>

<p>The utter inefficiency of most works of the kind, are well known to
every experienced housekeeper, serving but to lead the uninitiated
astray, who following implicitly the directions given have to lament in
the language of that homely but not inapt proverb, that their cake is
all dough. Among the few exceptions she would mention the Frugal
Housewife by Mrs. Child, which is a very useful book, and fully answers
its author's design; but that is limited as its name imports to the
plainest cooking, and is not intended for those who can afford to
consult their taste in preference to their purse. The writer of this
short but she trusts comprehensive work, has endeavored to combine both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>economy, and that which would be agreeable to the palate, but she has
never suffered the former to supersede the latter.</p>

<p>Although the mode of cooking is such as is generally practiced by good
notable Yankee housekeepers, yet the New England Cook Book is not so
local but that it will answer like a modern almanac, without any
material alteration for almost any meridian. It is intended for all
classes of society and embracing both the plainest and richest cooking,
joined to such minuteness of directions as to leave as little as
possible to the judgment of the practitioner, proving to the unskilled
quite a desideratum, while in the hands of the head of the culinary
department, it will prevent that incessant running to and fro for
directions, with which housekeepers' patience are too often tried. The
experienced cook may smile at the simplicity and minuteness of some of
the receipts, yet if she has witnessed as much good food spoiled by
improper cooking as the writer of these receipts, she will not think she
has been unnecessarily plain. In regard to the seasoning of food, it has
been found impossible to give any exact rules, as so much depends on the
quality of the food and seasoning.</p>

<p>The cook should be careful not to have the natural flavor of the food
overpowered by the seasoning, and where a variety of spices are used, no
one should predominate over the other.</p>

<p>Measuring has been adopted as far as practicable, in preference to
weighing, on account of its being more convenient. As many people have
not a set of measures, it has been thought best to use such utensils <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>as
every one has, viz. tumblers, tea cups, wine glasses, &amp;c. but as they
may be thought rather too indefinite by some, the exact quantity will
here be stated; most tumblers are a good half pint measure, wine glasses
usually hold half a gill, and table spoons the fifth of a gill; by tea
cups are meant the old fashioned ones, which hold very little over a
gill.</p>

<p>In conclusion the writer would give her sincere thanks, to those of her
friends who have kindly furnished her with many of their choice and rare
receipts, and to the public she would not add any thing more in its
favor, being strongly impressed with the truth of the adage, that the
proof of the pudding is in the eating.</p>

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="PRACTICAL_COOKERY" id="PRACTICAL_COOKERY"></a>PRACTICAL COOKERY.</h2>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-1" id="recipe-1">1.</a> <i>Meat.</i></h3>

<p>To be in perfection meat should be kept several days, when the weather
will admit of it. Beef and mutton should be kept at least a week in cold
weather, and poultry three or four days. In summer meat should be kept
in a cool airy place, away from the flies, and if there is any danger of
its spoiling sprinkle a little salt over it. When meat is frozen it
should be put in cold water and remain in it till the frost is entirely
out, if there is any frost in it when put to the fire, it will be
impossible to cook it well. Fresh meat should not be put into the pot
until the water boils. When meat is too salt, soak it in lukewarm water
for several hours, change the water before boiling it. Meat should boil
gently with just water enough to cover it, and the side that is to go up
on the table should be put down in the pot, as the scum that rises makes
the meat look dark, it should be taken off as soon as it rises. The
liquor in which all kinds of fresh meat is boiled, makes good soup.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-2" id="recipe-2">2.</a> <i>Roast Beef.</i></h3>

<p>The tender loin and first and second cuts of the rack are the best
roasting pieces, the third and fourth cuts are good. The lower part of a
rack of beef should be cut off as it prevents the meat from roasting
thoroughly. When the beef is put to the fire to roast a little salt
should be sprinkled on it, and the bony side turned towards the fire,
when the ribs get well heated through, turn the meat, put it to a brisk
fire and baste it frequently till done. If the meat is a thick piece
allow fifteen minutes to each pound, to roast it in, if thin less time
will be required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-3" id="recipe-3">3.</a> <i>Beef Steak.</i></h3>

<p>The tender loin is the best piece for broiling, that from the shoulder
clod or from the round is good and comes much cheaper. Beef before
broiling if not very tender, should be laid on a board and pounded. Wash
it in cold water, and broil it on a hot bed of coals, the quicker it is
cooked without being burnt the better it is. Cut up about quarter of a
pound of butter for 7 or 8 lbs. of beef, put the pieces into a platter
and when the steak is done, lay it on the butter, pepper and salt it on
both sides.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-4" id="recipe-4">4.</a> <i>Alamode Beef.</i></h3>

<p>The round of beef is the best piece to alamode. The shoulder clod is
good and comes cheaper, it is also good stewed without any spices. For
five lbs. of beef soak about a pound of bread in cold water, when soft
drain off the water, mash the bread fine, put in a piece of butter, half
the size of a hen's egg, together with half a tea spoonful of salt, the
same quantity of mace, pepper, and cloves, also a couple of eggs and a
table spoonful of flour, mix the whole well together, then cut gashes in
the beef, and fill them with half of the dressing, put it in a bake pan
with boiling water, enough to cover it. The bake pan lid should be just
hot enough to scorch flour, put a few coals and ashes on the top, let it
stew constantly for two hours, then place the reserved dressing on top
of the meat, put in a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, heat
the bake pan lid till hot enough to brown the dressing, stew it an hour
and a half longer. When you have taken up the meat, if the gravy is not
thick enough, mix a tea spoonful or two of flour with a little water,
and stir it in, put in a couple of wine glasses of white wine, and a
small piece of butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-5" id="recipe-5">5.</a> <i>Beef Liver.</i></h3>

<p>The best way to cook liver, is to pour boiling water on it, dip it in
salt and water, then broil it till nearly done, with two or three slices
of salt pork previously dipped in flour, cut up the meat and pork into
strips about two inches long, lay the whole into a pan with a little
water, salt and pepper, put in a little butter, stew it four or five
minutes. It is more economical to fry or broil it, but it is not as
nice.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-6" id="recipe-6">6.</a> <i>To Corn Beef.</i></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>To every gallon of cold water, put a quart of rock salt, an oz. of salt
<a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a>petre, a quarter of a lb. of sugar and a couple of table spoonsful of
blown salt. (Some people use molasses instead of sugar but it is not as
good). No boiling is necessary, put your beef in the brine, as long as
any salt remains at the bottom of the brine it is strong enough.
Whenever any scum rises, the brine should be scalded, skimmed and more
sugar, salt and salt petre put in. When a piece of beef is put in the
brine a little salt should be added, and if the weather is warm cut
gashes in the beef, and fill them with salt. Keep a heavy weight on the
beef in order to keep it under the brine. The top of the weight is a
good place to keep fresh meat from spoiling in hot weather. In very hot
weather, it is difficult to corn beef in cold brine before it spoils, on
this account it is a good plan to corn it in the pot, it is done in the
following manner, to six or eight lbs. of beef put a tea cup of salt,
sprinkle flour on the side that is to go up on the table and put it down
in the pot, without any water in it, then turn in cold water enough to
cover it, boil it two hours then fill up the pot and boil it an hour and
a half longer.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-7" id="recipe-7">7.</a> <i>Mutton.</i></h3>

<p>The saddle, is the best part for roasting, the shoulder and leg are good
roasted; but the latter is better boiled, with a piece of salt pork; a
tea cup of rice, improves the looks of it. Before putting the mutton
down to roast, rub a little butter on it, sprinkle on salt and pepper;
cloves, and <a name="corr5" id="corr5"></a>allspice improve it. Put a small piece of butter in the
dripping pan, and baste it frequently, the bony side should be turned
towards the fire first, and roasted. For boiling or roasting mutton,
allow a quarter of an hour to each pound.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-8" id="recipe-8">8.</a> <i>Veal.</i></h3>

<p>The loin of veal is the best roasting piece, the breast and rack are
good roasting pieces, the breast makes a good pot pie. The leg is nice
for frying, and when <a name="corr6" id="corr6"></a>several slices have been cut off for cutlets the
remainder is nice boiled with about half a pound of salt pork. Veal for
roasting should be salted and peppered, and have a little butter rubbed
on it, baste it frequently, and unless the meat is very fat put a small
piece of butter in the dripping pan when the meat is put down to roast.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-9" id="recipe-9">9.</a> <i>Veal Cutlets.</i></h3>

<p>Fry three or four slices of pork, when brown take them up. Cut part of a
leg of veal into slices about an inch thick and fry them in your pork
fat, when brown on both sides take it up, stir about half a tea cup of
clear water into the gravy, then mix a tea <a name="corr7" id="corr7"></a>spoonful or two of flour
with a little water and turn it in, soak a couple of slices of toasted
bread in the gravy lay them on the bottom of a platter place your meat,
and pork over the toast, then turn your gravy on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> meat. Some people
dip the veal into the white of an egg and roll it in pounded bread
crumbs before cooking it. It takes nearly an hour to cook this dish.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-10" id="recipe-10">10.</a> <i>Calf's Head.</i></h3>

<p>Boil the head two hours together with the lights and feet, put in the
liver when it has boiled an hour and twenty minutes, before the head is
done, tie up the brains in a bag and boil them with it. When these are
done take them up and mash them fine, season them with salt, pepper and
butter, sweet herbs if you like, use them as the dressing for the head.
Some people prefer part of the liver and the feet for dressing, they are
prepared like the brains. The liquor that the calf's head is boiled in
makes a nice soup seasoned in a plain way, like any other veal soup, or
seasoned turtle fashion. The liquor should stand till the day after the
head is boiled when the fat should be skimmed off.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-11" id="recipe-11">11.</a> <i>Collops.</i></h3>

<p>Cut part of a leg of veal into pieces three or four inches broad,
sprinkle flour on them, and fry in butter till brown, then turn in water
enough to cover the veal, when it boils take off the scum, put in two or
three onions, a blade of mace, let it stew gently three quarters of an
hour, put in a little salt, pepper and the juice of half a lemon. Take
it up, pour the gravy over it. The gravy should be previously thickened
with a little flour and water.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-12" id="recipe-12">12.</a> <i>Plaw.</i></h3>

<p>Boil a piece of lean veal till tender. Then take it up cut it into
strips three or four inches long, put it back into the pot, with the
liquor it was boiled in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> a couple of tea cups of rice to four lbs.
of the veal, put in a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, season
it with salt, pepper and sweet herbs, stew it gently till the water has
nearly boiled away. A little curry powder in this converts it into a
curry dish.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-13" id="recipe-13">13.</a> <i>A Fillet of Veal.</i></h3>

<p>Take a leg of veal, cut off the shank, and cut gashes in the remainder.
Make a dressing of bread soaked soft and mashed, season it with salt,
pepper and sweet herbs, chop a little raw pork fine, and put it into the
dressing, if you have not pork use a little butter. Fill the gashes in
the meat with the dressing, put it in a bake pan with water enough to
just cover it, put the remainder of the dressing on top of the meat. For
six lbs. of veal, allow two hours steady baking. A leg of veal is nice
prepared in this manner and roasted.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-14" id="recipe-14">14.</a> <i>Lamb.</i></h3>

<p>The fore and hind quarter of lamb are good roasting pieces. Sprinkle
salt and pepper on the lamb and turn the bony side towards the fire
first, if not fat, rub on a little butter and put a little in the
dripping pan, baste it frequently. These pieces are good stuffed like a
fillet of veal, and roasted, the leg is also good cooked in the same
manner, but it is better boiled with a little pork or salt, allow
fifteen minutes boiling to each lb. The breast of lamb is good roasted,
broiled, or corned and boiled, it is also good made into a pot pie. The
fore quarter with the ribs divided is good broiled, the bones of this as
well as of all other kinds of meat when put down to broil should be put
toward the fire, a little butter, pepper and salt should be put on it.
Lamb is very apt to spoil in warm weather, if you wish to keep a leg
several days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> put it in brine, it should not be put in with pork, as
fresh meat is apt to injure the pork.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-15" id="recipe-15">15.</a> <i>Shoulder of Lamb Grilled.</i></h3>

<p>The shoulder of lamb is good roasted or cooked in the following manner.
Score it in chequers about an inch long, rub it over with a little
butter and the yolk of an egg, then dip it into finely pounded bread
crumbs, sprinkle on salt, pepper and sweet herbs, broil or roast it till
of a light brown. This is good with plain gravy or sauce, made in the
following manner, with half a pint of the gravy, (or the same quantity
of drawn butter,) put a table spoonful of tomato catsup, the juice of
half a lemon, a little salt and pepper.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-16" id="recipe-16">16.</a> <i>Lamb's Fry.</i></h3>

<p>The heart and sweet bread are nice fried plainly, or dipped into the
white of an egg and fine bread crumbs, they should be fried in lard.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-17" id="recipe-17">17.</a> <i>Turkey.</i></h3>

<p>Take out the inwards and wash both the inside and outside of the turkey.
Prepare a dressing of either boiled potatoes mashed fine or bread soaked
in cold water, the water should be squeezed out of the bread, mash it
fine, add a small piece of butter or pork chopped fine, put in pepper,
salt, and sweet herbs if you like them, an egg mixed with the dressing
makes it cut smoother.</p>

<p>Fill the crop and body of the turkey with the dressing, sew it up, tie
up the legs and wings rub on a little salt and butter. Roast it from two
to three hours according to the size; twenty five minutes for every
pound is a good rule. A turkey should be roasted slowly at first and
basted frequently, the inwards of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> turkey should be boiled till
tender, and the liquor they are boiled in, used for the gravy, when you
have taken up the inwards, mix a little flour and water smoothly
together, and stir it into the skillet, put in a little of the drippings
of the turkey, season it with salt and pepper, and sweet herbs if you
like. Drawn butter is used for boiled turkey. A turkey for boiling
should be dressed like one for roasting, tie it up in a cloth unless you
boil rice in the pot with it, if you use rice, put in a tea cup two
thirds full, a small piece of pork boiled with the turkey, improves it.
If you wish to make a soup of the liquor in which the turkey is boiled,
let it stand till the next day and then skim off the fat.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-18" id="recipe-18">18.</a> <i>Goose.</i></h3>

<p>If a goose is tender under the wing, and you can break the skin easily
by running the head of a pin across the breast, there is no danger of
its being tough. A goose should be dressed in the same manner, and
roasted the same length of time, as a turkey.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-19" id="recipe-19">19.</a> <i>Chickens.</i></h3>

<p>Chickens for roasting or boiling, should have a dressing prepared like
that for turkies. Half a tea cup full of rice boiled with the chickens,
makes them look white, they will be less liable to break if the water is
cold when they are put in to boil, a little pork boiled with the
chickens improves them, if you do not boil any pork with them, put in a
little salt. Chickens for broiling should be split, the inwards taken
out, and the chicken washed inside and out, put the bony side down on
the gridiron, and broil it very slowly till brown then turn it, when
done take it up, salt, and butter it. About forty minutes is required to
broil a common sized chicken. For roast chicken, boil the liver and
gizzard by themselves and use the water for gravy, cut the inwards in
slices, and put them in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-20" id="recipe-20">20.</a> <i>Fricassee Chickens.</i></h3>

<p>The chickens should be jointed, the inwards taken out, and the chickens
washed, put them in a stew pan with the skin side down, on each layer
sprinkle salt and pepper; put in three or four slices of pork, just
cover them with water, and let them stew slowly till tender. Then take
them up, mix a tea spoonful of flour smoothly, with a little water, and
stir it into the gravy, add a piece of butter of the size of a hen's
egg, put the chickens back into the stew pan, let them stew slowly for
four or five minutes. When you have taken up the chickens, put two or
three slices of toast into the gravy, and when soaked soft lay it in a
platter and lay the chickens on top, and turn the gravy upon it. If you
wish to brown the chickens, reserve the pork and fry it by itself, when
brown take it up and put in the chickens, (when they are stewed tender,)
and let them fry till of a light brown.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-21" id="recipe-21">21.</a> <i>Pigeons.</i></h3>

<p>Take out the inwards and stuff them, with a dressing prepared like that
for turkies, put them in the pot with the breast side down, the water
should more than cover them, when nearly done put in a quarter of a lb.
of butter to every dozen of pigeons, mix a little flour and water and
stir into the gravy. When stewed tender, if you wish to brown them, take
them up, and fry them in a little pork fat or butter, an hour before
they are done, put on a heated bake pan lid. They are very good split
open and stewed with a dressing made and warmed up separately with a
little of the gravy. It takes about two hours to cook tender pigeons and
three for tough ones. Tender pigeons are good stuffed and roasted. They
should be buttered just before they are taken from the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-22" id="recipe-22">22.</a> <i>Ducks.</i></h3>

<p>Are good stewed like pigeons, or roasted. Two or three onions in the
dressing of wild ducks takes out the fishy taste. If ducks or any other
fowls are slightly injured by being kept too long, dip them in weak sal
eratus and water before cooking them.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-23" id="recipe-23">23.</a> <i>Baked Pig.</i></h3>

<p>Take out the inwards, cut off the first joint of the feet and boil them
till tender, take them up and take out the bones, chop them a little.
Prepare a dressing of bread soaked and mashed fine, season it with salt,
pepper, butter, and sweet herbs, if you like, fill the pig with the
dressing, rub a little butter on the out side to prevent its blistering.
If you wish to have it go on the table whole, put it into a long
dripping pan, put in a little water, set it in a well heated oven, bake
it from two hours and a half to three, according to the size. When done
take out a little of the dressing, and mix it with the chopped inwards,
and feet, put in a little butter pepper and salt, let the pig stand in

<p>Boil ears, forehead, and rind, (the cheek is good but is better corned
and smoked), boil them till the meat will almost drop from the bones,
take them up when cold, cut the meat in strips about an inch long and
half an inch broad, warm it in a little of the liquor in which the meat
was boiled, season it with pepper, salt, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon,
when hot take it up and put it in a strong bag, put a heavy weight upon
it, and let it remain till perfectly cold.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-25" id="recipe-25">25.</a> <i>Souse.</i></h3>

<p>Take <a name="corr8" id="corr8"></a>pig's ears and feet, clean them thoroughly, boil them till tender,
take them out and when cold split them, lay them in a deep dish, pour on
boiling vinegar strongly spiced with pepper corns, cloves and nutmeg,
put in a little salt. When cold they are fit to cook. Fry them in lard.
They will keep good pickled for four or five weeks.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-26" id="recipe-26">26.</a> <i>Tripe.</i></h3>

<p>After being scoured should be soaked in salt and water, seven or eight
days, changing the water every other day. Then boil it till tender,
which will take eight or ten hours. It is then fit for broiling, frying,
or pickling. It is pickled like souse.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-27" id="recipe-27">27.</a> <i>Ham.</i></h3>

<p>A ham that weighs ten lbs. should be boiled four or five hours, if too
salt the water should be changed. Before it goes on to the table take
off the rind, put pepper or whole clove in the form of diamonds all over
it. The Virginia way of curring Hams is the following, dissolve two oz.
of salt petre, two tea spoonsful of sal eratus, for every 16 lbs. of
ham, add molasses in the proportion of a gallon to a hogshead of brine.
Make a salt pickle as strong as possible, put the above ingredients in
it, then put the hams in, and let them remain for six weeks. Take them
out and smoke them for three months. Hams cured in this way will keep
good a long time and are very fine flavored.</p>

<p>Cut off the roots of the tongues, make a brine like that for curing
beef, let the tongues remain in it for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> week, then, smoke them eight
or ten days. They require boiling four or five hours. The roots make
very nice mince pies, but are not good smoked.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-29" id="recipe-29">29.</a> <i>Curries.</i></h3>

<p>Chickens, pigeons, mutton chops, veal, lamb and lobsters, make good
curries. The meat should be boiled till nearly tender, if made of fowls
they should be jointed before they are boiled. Put a little butter in a
stew pan, when melted put in the meat and cover it with part of the
liquor it was boiled in, let it stew for ten or fifteen minutes. For 4
lbs. of meat, mix a table spoonful of curry powder, with one of flour,
or a tea cup of boiled rice, put in a little water, and a table spoonful
of melted butter, and half a tea spoonful of salt, turn the whole over
the meat, and let it stew six or eight minutes.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-30" id="recipe-30">30.</a> <i>Curry Powder.</i></h3>

<p>Pound fine, one oz. of ginger, one of mustard, one of pepper three of
coriander seed, the same quantity of turmeric, half an oz. of cardamums,
quarter of an oz. of cayenne pepper, the same quantity of cinnamon and
cummin seed. Pound the whole well together, sift and put them in a
bottle.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-31" id="recipe-31">31.</a> <i>Chicken Pie.</i></h3>

<p>Joint the chickens, and boil them, till nearly tender in water just
sufficient to cover them. Take them up and lay them in a dish, lined
with pie crust, on each layer of the chickens, sprinkle pepper and salt,
put in a little of the liquor that they were boiled in, three or four
slices of pork and a small piece of butter, sprinkle flour over the
whole. Cover it with a nice pie crust, ornament it with pastry cut in
narrow strips. Bake it an hour and a quarter.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-32" id="recipe-32">32.</a> <i>Beef and Mutton Pie.</i></h3>

<p>Take meat that is tender, pound it out thin, and boil it ten minutes.
Take it up, cut off the bony and gristly parts, season the meat highly
with pepper and salt, butter it, and cut it in narrow strips. Line a
deep dish, with piecrust, put in the meat, and to each layer, put a tea
spoonful of tomato catsup, and a table spoonful of water, sprinkle flour
over the whole, and cover it with piecrust, ornament it as you please
with pastry. Cold roast, or boiled beef and mutton, cut in bits, and
seasoned highly with salt and pepper, make a nice pie, put them in a
dish, and turn a little melted butter over them, pour on water till you
can just see it at the top.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-33" id="recipe-33">33.</a> <i>Chicken and Veal Pot Pie.</i></h3>

<p>Boil the meat until about half done, if chickens they should be jointed.
Take up the meat, and put it in a pot with a layer of crust, to each
layer of meat; have a layer of crust on the top, cover the whole with
the liquor the meat was boiled in. Keep a tea kettle of boiling water,
to turn in when the water boils away, (cold water makes the crust
heavy.) If you wish to have it brown, heat a bake pan lid, and cover the
pot while it is cooking, which takes about an hour. The crust for the
pie is good, made like common pie crust, only very plain, roll it about
an inch thick, cut it with a tumbler, into small cakes. Raised pie
crust, is generally preferred to any other, it is made in the following
manner. Rub together, three pints of flour one cup of butter, half a tea
spoonful of salt, and then turn in a tea cup of yeast, and half a pint
of water. Set it in a warm place to rise, when risen, (which will be in
the course of ten or twelve hours, in cold weather,) roll it out, and
cut it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> into small cakes. If it is not stiff enough to roll out, knead
in a little flour, if too stiff, put in a little water. Potatoe pie
crust is good, boil the potatoes, peel and mash them fine, put in a tea
spoonful of salt, a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, and half
a pint of milk, mix flour with it till of the right consistency to roll
out, cut it into cakes, and put them with the meat. A very good way to
make the crust, when you happen to have unbaked wheat bread; is to roll
out the dough several times and spread butter on it each time, let it
lay about half an hour, before you put it with the meat.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-34" id="recipe-34">34.</a> <i>To Frizzle Beef.</i></h3>

<p>Take tender smoked beef and shave it off thin, put it in a stew pan,
with boiling water enough to cover it, let it stew ten or fifteen
minutes; three or four minutes before it is done, thicken the water it
is stewed in with a little flour, when taken up sprinkle on a little
pepper. This makes a nice dish for breakfast, provided the beef is moist
and tender.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-35" id="recipe-35">35.</a> <i>Warmed over Meats.</i></h3>

<p>Boiled or roasted veal makes a nice dish, chopped very fine, and warmed
up with a little pepper, a small piece of butter, and a little water, if
you have gravy, it is very good instead of the butter and water. A
little nutmeg and the rind and juice of half a lemon improve it, the
rind should be chopped very fine, (none of the white part should be
used.) When well heated through, take it up and cut a couple of lemons
in slices, and lay over it. Veal and fresh or salt beef, are all of them
good, minced fine, with boiled potatoes, and warmed up with pepper, salt
and gravy, if you have not gravy, use a little butter and water. Some
people like boiled onions, or turnips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> chopped fine, and mixed with the
minced meat, instead of potatoes. Veal, lamb and mutton, are good cut in
small strips, and warmed with boiled potatoes, cut in slices, and
pepper, salt, and gravy. Roast beef and mutton, if not cooked too much,
are nice cut in slices, and just scorched on a gridiron. Meat when
warmed over, should only be on the fire just long enough to get heated
well through, if on the fire long, most of the nourishment of the meat
will be extracted, and it will be very indigestible. Cold fowls are nice
jointed and warmed up, with a little water and salt, then take the <a name="corr9" id="corr9"></a>fowls
out of the water, put them in a frying pan, that has a little hot butter
in it, and fry them, till of a light brown, they should have a little
flour sprinkled over them before they are browned. Thicken the water
with flour, that the fowls were warmed in, put a little butter in it,
and turn it over the meat, when taken up.</p>

quarter of a lb. of butter, previously cut in small pieces, set it where
it will melt gradually. If carefully mixed it will be free from lumps,
if not strain it, before it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> put on to the table. If the butter is to
be eaten on fish, cut up several boiled eggs into it. A little curry

pepper and salt. This is nice for fish, or boiled eggs.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-39" id="recipe-39">39.</a> <i>Roast Meat Gravy.</i></h3>

<p>Meat when put down to roast, should have about a pint of water in the
dripping pan. If you like your gravy very rich, skim off the top of the
drippings to your meat, and use them, if you like it plain, stir up the
drippings, strain them and put in a skillet and boil them. Mix a tea
spoonful of flour, with a little cold water, and stir it into the gravy.
Lamb and veal require a little butter in the gravy.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-42" id="recipe-42">42.</a> <i>Rice Sauce.</i></h3>

<p>Boil half a tea cup of rice, till soft, then stir in two table spoonsful

<p>Pare and quarter the apples, take out the cores, stew them in cider.
When soft take them up, put in a piece of butter of the size of a
walnut, to every quart of the sauce, sweeten it to your taste, with
brown sugar. Another way which is very good, is to boil the apples, with
a few quinces, in new cider, and molasses enough to sweeten them, till
reduced to half the quantity. This kind of sauce will keep good for
several months.</p>

pint of thin starch, and stir it into the butter and sugar. If you wish
to have it foam, put in a little cider. Cider instead of wine, or
brandy, answers very well, for common pudding sauce.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-50" id="recipe-50">50.</a> <i>Tomato Catsup.</i></h3>

<p>Wipe the tomatoes, which should be perfectly ripe. Boil them till soft

with salt, pepper, cloves, allspice and mace, then boil it fifteen
minutes. Let it stand twenty four hours, then take off the watery part,
bottle the remainder, seal it tight, and keep it in a cool place. Made
in this way it will keep the year round. The catsup, should be stewed in
tin, and the later in the season it is made, the less liable will it be
to spoil.</p>

boil half a tea cup of salt. Many people do not put their fish into the
pot, until the water boils, but it is not a good plan, as the outside
gets cooked too much, before the inside is cooked sufficiently. Fish for
frying, should be wiped dry after being washed, and flour sprinkled on
them. For five or six lbs. of fish, fry three or four slices of pork,
when brown, take them up, and put in the fish, if the pork does not make
sufficient fat, to fry the fish in, add a little lard. For good plain
gravy, mix a tea spoonful or two of flour with a little water, and turn
in, when you have taken up the fish; when well mixed, add a little
butter and pepper, when it boils, turn it on to the fish. Boiled fish,
should be served up with drawn butter, or liver sauce. For a garnish to
boiled fish, boil several eggs five minutes, cool them in water, then
take off the shells, and cut them in slices, and lay them round the
fish; parsly and pepper grass, are also a pretty garnish for boiled
fish. For broiling fish the gridiron should be greased with a little
butter, the inside of the fish should be broiled first.</p>

<p>Fresh shad are the best bloated and broiled; but they are good boiled or

boiled, without any soaking, if liked quite salt, if not pour on
scalding water, and let them soak in it, half an hour, then drain off
the water, and boil them twenty <a name="corr12" id="corr12"></a>minutes. Salt shad and mackerel for
broiling, should be soaked twenty four hours, in cold water, the water
should be changed several times. To salt twenty five shad, mix one pound
of sugar, a peck of rock salt, two quarts of fine salt, and quarter of a
pound of salt petre. Put a layer of it at the bottom of the keg, then a
layer of shad, with the skin side down, sprinkle on the mixed salt,
sugar, and salt petre, and so on till you get in all the shad. Lay a

take them up, and mix a tea spoonful of flour, with a little water, and
stir it into the gravy, add about an ounce of butter, and cloves. Half a
pint of white wine, and the juice of half a lemon, or a tea cup of
tomato catsup, improve it. Bass and Cod, make the best chowder. Some

<p>Should be soaked in lukewarm water, till the skin will come off easily.
Scrape it, and change the water, and put it over a moderate fire, where
it will keep warm without boiling, boiling hardens rather than softens
it. It takes three hours to soak it soft. It should be cut into good
square pieces, and served up with drawn butter. Cold codfish is good,
minced up fine, with potatoes, and warmed up with butter, and a little
water.</p>

tea cup of salt, with four or five pounds of lobsters. When cold crack
the shells, take out the meat. Be careful to get out the blue vein, and
what is called the lady, as they are very unhealthy.</p>

<p>Lobsters are good cold, or warmed up, with a little vinegar, pepper,
salt, and butter. A way of dressing them, which looks very prettily, is
to pick out the spawn, and red chord, mash it fine, and rub it through
the sieve, put in a little butter and salt, cut the lobsters into small
squares, and warm it together with the spawn, over a moderate fire. When
hot take it up, and garnish it with parsly. The chord and spawn when

take the clams out of them, and warm them, with a little of the liquor,
they were boiled in, and a little butter, pepper, and salt. Soak a slice
of toasted bread, in the clam liquor, put it in the bottom of a dish and
turn the clams on to it when hot. For clam pancakes, take some of the
clam liquor, and mix with a little flour, to a pint of flour put two
beaten eggs, and a little salt, fry them in lard. Very large long clams
are nice taken out of the shell without boiling and broiled.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-83" id="recipe-83">83.</a> <i>Vegetables.&mdash;Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p>The best way to cook potatoes, is to pare and put them in a pot, with
just boiling water enough to prevent their burning, put in a little
salt, and cover them up tight, let them stew till you can stick a fork
through them easily. If there is any water in the pot turn it off, and
put it back on the fire, and let the potatoes steam a few moments
longer. The easiest way to cook them, is to put them in boiling water,
with the skins on, they should boil constantly till done, if you wish to
have them mealy; they are more mealy, to have the water turned off, as
soon as you can stick a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> fork through them easily, and put in a warm
place, where they will steam, the lid should be off. Cold, mashed, or
whole potatoes are nice cut in slices, and fried in lard or butter.
Sweet potatoes are the best baked. Most potatoes will boil sufficiently
in half an hour, new Irish potatoes will boil in less time.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-84" id="recipe-84">84.</a> <i>Turnips.</i></h3>

<p>White turnips require about as much boiling, as potatoes. When tender
take them up, peel and mash them, season them with a little salt and
butter. Yellow turnips require about two hours boiling, if very large,
they should be split in two.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-85" id="recipe-85">85.</a> <i>Beets.</i></h3>

<p>Beets should not be cut, or scraped before they are boiled. In summer
they will boil in an hour, in winter it takes three hours to boil them
tender. Boiled beets cut in slices, and put in vinegar, for several
days, are nice.</p>

<p>The best way to cook them, is to scrape and split them in two, put them
in a stew pan with the flat side down, pour on boiling water enough to
cover them, when done take them up, and butter them. Many people boil
parsnips whole, but it is not a good plan, as the outside gets done too
much, before the inside is cooked sufficiently.</p>

the edges should be cut off; if the beans are old put saleratus in the
pot, in the proportion of half a tea spoonful of saleratus, to a peck of
beans it should be put in before the beans. Boil them from twenty five
to thirty minutes, salt and butter them when you take them up. Beans and
all other summer vegetables, should not be picked longer than one day

cultivated. The roots are nice boiled tender, and cut in thin slices and
put in soup, or meat pie, or cooked in the following manner, and eaten
with meat. Scrape and cut them in slices, and boil them, till perfectly

Boil it seventeen minutes, then turn off the water very close, put it
over a moderate fire with the lid of the pot off, let it steam fifteen
minutes. Rice boiled in this manner is superior to any other; but care
must be taken to be exact in the time of boiling and steaming, as a few
moments variation makes a great deal of difference with it, the water
should boil when it is put in the pot, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> allowed to stop boiling

<p>If you do not like them fiery, take out the seeds, they should be taken
out carefully with a penknife, so as not to mangle the pepper. Soak them
in salt and water, eight or nine days, change the water each day, and
keep them in a warm place. If you like them stuffed, put in cinnamon,
cloves, mace, and nasturtions, lay them in cold spiced vinegar. Tomatoes
when very small, and green, are good pickled with the peppers.</p>

<p>Procure muskmelons as late in the season as possible, and those that are
very green; if pickled early, they are apt to spoil. Take out the seeds,
and soak them in salt and water, three or four days. Then take them out
of the water, sprinkle powdered cloves, and nutmeg, round on the inside
of the melon, fill them with strips of horseradish, cinnamon, small
string beans, or flag root, nasturtion, and radish tops, fill the
crevices, with American mustard seed; put on the covers, and sew each
one up in a bag. Lay the melons in a stone jar, with the side that the

<p>Pour boiling water on them, when first picked; and let them lay in it
eight or ten hours, then put them in cold vinegar, with alum and salt,
in the proportion of quarter of a pound of the first, and a pint of the
last, to every half barrel of pickles. When you have done picking your
cucumbers for pickling, turn the vinegar from them, boil and skim it
till clear, throw in the cucumbers, and let them boil a few moments,
then put them in fresh cold vinegar, with salt and alum; a few peppers
improve them. Whenever any scum rises on any kind of pickles turn off
the vinegar, scald and skim it, turn it back when cold on the pickles.
Pickles of all kinds should be stirred up occasionally, and if there are
any soft ones among them, they should be thrown away, and the vinegar
scalded; if very weak, it should be thrown away and fresh added. The
vinegar when scalded, should not be allowed to cool in brass. Another
method of pickling cucumbers, which is very good, is to put them in salt
and water, as you pick them, change the water once in three days; when
you have done picking your cucumbers, take them out of the salt and
water, and put them in cold vinegar, with alum, salt, and pepper corns

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-114" id="recipe-114">114.</a> <i>Wheat Bread.</i></h3>

<p>For six common sized loaves of bread, take three pints of boiling water,
and mix with five quarts of flour; when thoroughly mixed, add three
pints of cold water, stir it till the whole of the dough is equally
cold; when lukewarm stir in half a pint of yeast, a table spoonful of
salt, knead in flour till stiff enough to mould up, cover it over and if
the weather is cold set it near the fire to rise. To ascertain when it
is risen, cut it through the middle with a knife, and if full of small
holes like a sponge, it is sufficiently light. If the dough gets sour
before you are ready to bake it, dissolve two or more tea spoonsful of
saleratus (according to the acidity of it,) in a cup of water, and
strain it on the dough, work it in well, mould it up, slash it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> the
sides, to prevent its cracking when baked, put it in buttered pans, and
let it stand ten or twelve minutes before you bake it; if you like it
quite brown let it stand in the oven an hour and a half. If the wheat is
grown, use all boiling water, and let it stand till cool before putting
in the yeast. Some people, have an idea that it kills the life of the
flour, to scald it, but it is a mistake, it makes it much sweeter, and
prevents its moulding soon in warm weather; bread made in this manner is
very nearly as good as that which is wet with milk. Care must be taken,
not to put in the yeast when the dough is hot, as it will scald it and
prevent its rising. Bread is much better in the winter, for being made
several days before it is baked, it should be kept in a cool place, and
a little flour knead in every day. Most ovens require heating an hour
and a half for bread, some will heat sufficiently in an hour, a brisk
fire should be kept up, the doors in the room should be kept shut in
cold weather. Pine, and ash, or birch mixed, are the best wood for
heating an oven. To ascertain if your oven is of the right temperature,
when cleared throw in a little flour, if it browns in the course of a
minute, it is hot enough, if it turns black wait several minutes before
you put in your things, if not hot enough, set in a furnace of live
coals, after you have put your things in.</p>

<p>For four loaves of bread, take three quarts of boiling water and turn it
into three quarts of flour. When lukewarm put in a cup of yeast, a table
spoonful of salt, set it in a warm place to rise, when light knead in
flour till stiff enough to mould up, then let it stand till risen again,
before moulding it up.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-116" id="recipe-116">116.</a> <i>Rye Bread.</i></h3>

<p>Wet up the rye flour with lukewarm milk, if you have it; if not water
will do, and the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> of yeast as for wheat flour; put in a
small piece of butter and a little salt. It should not be kneaded as
stiff as wheat flour, as it will be hard when baked; let it stand in the
pans, after it is moulded up, half an hour.</p>

<p>Brown Bread is made by mixing, Indian meal and Rye flour. The Indian
meal should be scalded; when cool, put in the rest of the ingredients,
in the same proportion as for plain rye bread. Bake it between two and

<p>Turn a pint of lukewarm milk, into a pint of flour, mix them well
together, then turn in a small tea cup of yeast, two tea spoonsful of
salt, and flour enough to make a thick batter. Set it in a warm place to
rise. When light, put in a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg,
and half a tea cup of lukewarm water, the butter should be melted before
it is put in; knead in flour until stiff enough to roll out. Let it
stand till risen again, then roll it out, about half an inch thick, cut
it into narrow strips, braid and twist them a little, as you braid them.
Lay them on flat buttered tins, let them remain from twenty to thirty
minutes, then bake them slowly.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-119" id="recipe-119">119.</a> <i>Yeast.</i></h3>

<p>Boil a small handful of hops, in two quarts of water, when all the
strength is obtained from them, strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> the liquor, and put it back on
the fire, take a little of it, and mix smoothly with a couple of table
spoonsful of flour, mix it with the boiling liquor, when it has boiled
five or six minutes, take it from the fire, and when lukewarm, add a tea
cup of yeast, keep it in a warm place till risen, then stir in a table
spoonful of salt, turn it into a jar, and cover it up tight. Some people
keep yeast in bottles but they are very apt to burst. Yeast made in this
manner, will keep a fortnight in the warmest weather. If your yeast
appears to be sour, put a little saleratus in just before you put it
into your bread; if it does not foam well, it is too stale to use.
Another method of raising bread, which is very good, is to leave about
half a pound of dough, from one week's baking to another. It should be
rolled out thin and dried in the sun, about two hours before you wish to
bake your bread, turn a quart of warm water to it, and set it near the
fire till light, which will be in the course of an hour, then scald your
dough, and when lukewarm, stir in the yeast; it will raise the bread in
the course of an hour. This can only be used two or three times, without
having fresh yeast put to it.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-120" id="recipe-120">120.</a> <i>Yeast Cakes.</i></h3>

<p>Stir into a pint of yeast, a table spoonful of salt, and Indian meal
sufficient to enable you to roll it out. When rolled thin, cut it into
cakes with a tumbler, and dry them in the wind; in hot weather, care
must be taken to keep them from the sun, or they will ferment; when
perfectly dry, tie them up in a bag, and keep them in a cool dry place.
To raise four or five loaves of bread, take one of these cakes, and put
it in half a pint of warm water, set it near the fire to rise, when
light use it to raise your dough.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-139" id="recipe-139">139.</a> <i>Observations respecting Sweet Cakes.</i></h3>

<p>If you wish your cake to be good, it must be made of nice materials. The
butter, eggs, and flour should not be stale, and the sugar should be
dry, and of a light color. Brown sugar answers for most kinds of cakes,
if rolled free from lumps, and stirred with the butter, until it is a
very light color. The flour should be sifted and if damp, it should be
dried perfectly, or it will make the cake heavy. Where sifted flour for
cake is measured, it should be shaken down in the measure to be
accurate; if there is not flour enough in cake, it will not be light.
The eggs should be beaten to a froth, on a shallow plate, and for very
nice cake the whites and yolks, should be beaten separately. Where
saleratus is used, it should be thoroughly dissolved and strained.
Raisins for cake, should have the seeds taken out, and Zante currants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
should be carefully washed and rubbed in a cloth, to get out the sticks;
they should be perfectly dried before they are put into the cake. All
kinds of cake that has not yeast in it, should be stirred till it goes
into the oven. It should not be moved while in the oven, if it can be
avoided. The quicker most kinds of cake are baked, without burning, the
better they will be. It is impossible to give any exact rules as to the
time for baking cake, as so much depends on the heat of the oven; it
should be narrowly watched and if likely to burn covered with a thick
paper. To ascertain when rich cake is sufficiently baked, stick a clean
broom splinter through the thickest part, and if none of the cake
adheres to it, it is baked enough. When cake that is baked on flat tins,
moves easily on them it is sufficiently done.</p>

with flour enough to enable you to roll it out easily. Roll it about
half an inch thick, and lay it on flat buttered tins; bake it as soon as
rolled out in a quick oven a few moments. Gingerbread to be very nice,
should be made of good molasses, and baked very quick. Some people use

roll out easily. Roll it out thin, spread on the reserved shortening,
then sprinkle on the remainder of your flour, and roll it up. Cut it

thin, butter your pie plates, and put it on them, fill your plates with
your fruit, roll out the upper crust lightly, about half an inch thick,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> cover your pies, pare it off neatly round the edges of the plates.

butter, cut it into thin slices, and roll it out thin as possible on a
moulding board; in order to do this a great deal of flour should be

<p>The best kind of meat for mince pies, is neats tongue and feet, and
chickens; a shank of beef makes very good pies. Boil your meat till

chop it very fine and mix it with double the quantity of chopped apple;
if the meat is not fat, put in a little suet or melted butter, moisten
it with cider, add cloves, mace, or nutmeg, and cinnamon, to your taste,
sweeten it with molasses and sugar, add a little salt. If you wish to
have your pies very rich, put in wine or brandy to your taste, the juice
and peel of a lemon, the peel should be grated, and stoned raisins and
citron cut in small strips. Bake the pies in shallow plates. Make
apertures in the upper crust, before you cover the pies. Bake the pies

this manner are much better than with the stones taken out, as the
prussic acid of the stones, gives the pie a fine flavor. Dried peaches
should be stewed and sweetened, before being made into pies; they do not
require any spice.</p>

ware but iron, will do to preserve in, but earthen ware is the best on
account of its not imparting an unpleasant taste, to the sweet meats.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-234" id="recipe-234">234.</a> <i>To Preserve Quinces.</i></h3>

<p>Quinces if very ripe, are best pared and cut in slices about an inch
thick, the cores should be taken out carefully with a small knife, then
put the quinces in clarified syrup, and boil them till you can stick a
broom splinter through them easily, take them up and put them in jars,
and turn the syrup over them, cover them up, and put them in a cool
place, as soon as done. Quinces preserved in this manner retain more of
their natural flavor, but they cannot be preserved in this way without
they are very ripe. If not very ripe pare and halve them, and take out
the cores. Boil the quinces till tender, then take them out, strain the
water they were boiled in, and use it to make a syrup for the quinces,
allow a pound of sugar to a pound of the fruit, when clarified put in
the quinces and boil them slowly half an hour. Set them away in jars
covered with a paper wet in brandy. Look at them in the course of three
or four days, and if they have begun to ferment, turn off the syrup, and
scald it, then turn it back on the quinces. Some people boil the cores
of the quinces with them, but the syrup does not look as nice for it. A
cheap way of preserving quinces, which is very good for common use, is
to boil the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> parings and cores in cider till tender, then strain the
cider, and for ten pounds of quince, put in two pounds of brown sugar,
and a couple of quarts of molasses, and the beaten whites of two eggs;
put it on the fire, clarify it, then put in the quinces, which should be
pared and halved, put in the peel of an orange, boil them till tender.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-235" id="recipe-235">235.</a> <i>Quince Marmalade.</i></h3>

<p>Wash and quarter them, put them on the fire, with a little water, and
stew them till tender enough to rub through a sieve. When strained, put
to a pound of pulp, a pound of brown sugar, set it back on the fire, and
let it stew slowly, stir it constantly. To ascertain when it is done,
take a little of it out and let it get cold, if it then cuts smooth and
clear it is sufficiently stewed. Crab apple marmalade, is made in the
same manner.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-236" id="recipe-236">236.</a> <i>To Preserve Pears.</i></h3>

<p>Take an ounce of race ginger, for every pound of pears. Scrape off the

from the fire, put in your sugar, allowing three quarters of a pound to
a pound of the pears, set it on the fire, clarify it, then put in the
pears, if very small they are good preserved whole, boil them till
tender, then put them in jars tightly covered, set them away in a cool
place. In the course of five or six days, boil the syrup again, and turn
it on them while hot. Choke and Vergoulouse are the best pears for
preserving. The ginger can be omitted if not liked.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-237" id="recipe-237">237.</a> <i>To Preserve Peaches.</i></h3>

<p>Pare your peaches, which should be very ripe, and if you wish to
preserve them whole, allow a pound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> sugar, to a pound of fruit. Take
lump sugar, break it into small pieces, and dip each piece into cold
water, let it be in just long enough to get saturated with the water,
then put the lumps into a preserving kettle, set the kettle over a slow
fire, when the sugar has dissolved, put in your peaches, boil them
twenty minutes. These as well as all other sweet meats, should be set
away in a cool place, as soon as done, if allowed to stand by the fire
for a few hours, the syrup will not look clear; all preserves should be
covered up tight. Let them remain several days, then turn the syrup from
them, scald it, and turn it back on to them, while hot. If you preserve
your peaches without the stones, three quarters of a pound of sugar to a
pound of fruit is sufficient, take those that are mellow and juicy, pare
and halve them, take out the stones, put them in a deep dish; on each
layer of peach, sprinkle your sugar, let them stand three or four hours,
then put them on the fire with very little water, let them boil slowly
for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Take nice tart apples, halve and quarter them, and take out the cores.
For a pound of apples, allow three quarters of a pound of sugar. When
you have clarified your syrup, put in the apples, with the skin of a
lemon pared thin. When the apples are tender, take them up, and let the
syrup remain till cold, then turn it over them. Apples preserved in this
manner, will keep but a few days. Crab apples should be preserved whole,
with the skins on, and to a pound of the apples put a pound of sugar.</p>

When clear turn it into cups or glasses, and set them where the jelly
will congeal, but not so cold as to freeze it. This kind of jelly will
not keep longer than two or three days in warm weather. A knuckle of
veal makes a jelly as good as calves' feet, it is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> in the same
manner. Jellies and sweet meats are less liable to ferment, if kept in
glass jars or bottles. A paper wet in spirits and put over sweet meats,
has a tendency to prevent their fermenting. Sweet meats should be
carefully watched during warm weather, and if fermentation commences
turn the syrup from them, scald it, and turn it back.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-257" id="recipe-257">257.</a> <i>Coffee.</i></h3>

<p>To make good strong coffee, allow for each person a heaping table
spoonful of ground coffee, and a pint of water. Put your coffee into a
tin pot, with a piece of fish skin about the size of a ninepence, to two
or three quarts of water, turn on your water boiling hot, and boil the
coffee from fifteen to twenty minutes, take it off, and let it stand to
settle five or six minutes, then turn it off carefully. French coffee is
made in a German filter, the water is turned on to it boiling hot, an
ounce to each person is allowed, put in a piece of fish skin before you
turn on the water. When cream cannot be preserved for coffee, boiled
milk is a good substitute. Many people dislike to settle coffee with
fish skin, thinking it imparts a disagreeable taste to the coffee, but
it is owing to its not being prepared properly, the skin should be taken
from mild codfish, washed, and cut into small pieces and dried
perfectly. The white of an egg, egg shells, and isinglass, are all good
to settle coffee. The best kind of coffee is old Java, and Mocha; before
it is roasted, it should be hung over the fire two or three hours to
dry, if dried in the oven it looses its strength, it should be hung at
such a distance from the fire, as to be in no danger of burning. When
dry put it on hot coals, and stir it constantly till done, which is
ascertained by biting one of the lightest kernels, if it is brittle, the
whole is done. Put it in a box, and cover it up tight, to keep in the
steam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Coffee is much better roasted in a coffee roaster, than a kettle, as the
fine aromatic flavor of the coffee is preserved, which escapes in a
great measure, when roasted in an open kettle.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="recipe-270" id="recipe-270">270.</a> <i>Smallage Cordial.</i></h3>

<p>Take the young sprouts of smallage, wash and drain them till perfectly
dry. Cut them into small pieces, and put them in a bottle, with stoned
raisins, a layer of each alternately; when the bottle is two thirds
full,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> fill it up with good French brandy. Cork it up, let it stand four
or five days, then pour in as much more brandy, as you can get in. It
will be fit for use in the course of a few days.</p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-1" id="hint-1">1.</a> <i>To make Essence of Lemon.</i></h3>

<p>Take one drachm of the best oil of lemon, and two ounces of strong
rectified spirit. Mix the spirit by degrees, with the oil. Another way
to procure the essence of the peel, is to rub the peel with lumps of
sugar, till the yellow part is all taken up. Scrape off the surface of
the sugar, and press it down tight, in a preserving pot, and cover it
tight; a little of this sugar gives a fine flavor to pies or cake. This
mode of procuring the essence of the peel, is superior to any other, as
the fine flavor of the peel is extracted without any alloy.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-2" id="hint-2">2.</a> <i>Essence of Ginger.</i></h3>

<p>Put three ounces of fresh grated ginger, an ounce of thin cut lemon
peel, into a quart of brandy, or proof spirit, bottle and cork it, let
it stand for ten days, shaking it up each day, it will then be fit for
use. A few drops of this, in a little water, or on a lump of sugar,
answers all the purposes of ginger tea, and is much more convenient and
palatable.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-3" id="hint-3">3.</a> <i>Rose Water.</i></h3>

<p>Gather your roses on a dry day, when full blown, pick off the leaves,
and to a peck of them, put a quart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> of water. Put them in a cold still,
and put it over a slow fire, the slower they are distilled the better.
When distilled put it in the bottles, let it stand a couple of days,
then cork it tight.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-4" id="hint-4">4.</a> <i>Spice Brandy.</i></h3>

<p>Into a large wide mouthed bottle, put French brandy, and fresh rose
leaves, or lemon and orange peel. When this has stood a week, it is nice
spice for pies, puddings and cake. Peach meats or almonds steeped in
brandy are very good spice for custards.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-5" id="hint-5">5.</a> <i>Barley Water.</i></h3>

<p>Take a couple of ounces of pearl barley, wash it in cold water, and put
it into half a pint of boiling water, and let it boil four or five
minutes, then turn off the water, and pour on two quarts of boiling
water, strain it, and put to it two ounces of figs sliced, two of stoned
raisins, half an ounce of liquorice cut into small bits, and bruised,
boil it till reduced to a quart, and strain it. This is a very wholesome
drink in fevers.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-6" id="hint-6">6.</a> <i>Water Gruel.</i></h3>

<p>Mix a couple of table spoonsful of Indian meal, with one of flour and a
little water, stir it into a pint of boiling water, let it boil six or
eight minutes, then take it up put in a piece of butter of the size of a
walnut, pepper and salt, to your taste, and nutmeg, or cinnamon if you
like, turn it on to toasted bread or crackers. To convert this into
caudle, add a little ale; wine or brandy, and loaf sugar.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-7" id="hint-7">7.</a> <i>Wine Whey.</i></h3>

<p>Into a pint of milk while boiling, stir a couple of wine glasses of
wine, let it boil for a moment, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> take it off, when the curd has
settled, turn off the whey, and sweeten it with loaf sugar. Where wine
cannot be procured, cider, or half the quantity of vinegar, is a good
substitute.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-8" id="hint-8">8.</a> <i>Stomachic Tincture.</i></h3>

<p>Bruise an ounce and a half of Peruvian bark, and one of bitter dried
orange peel. Steep it in brandy or proof spirit, for a fortnight,
shaking it each day. Let it remain for a couple of days without shaking
it, then decant the liquor. A tea spoonful of it in a wine glass of
water, is a fine tonic.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-9" id="hint-9">9.</a> <i>Beef Tea.</i></h3>

<p>Broil a pound of fresh beef ten minutes, take it up, pepper and salt it,
cut it into small pieces, and turn a pint of boiling water on to it, let
it steep in a warm place for half an hour, then strain it off, and it is
fit to drink. This is a quick way of making it, but the best way is to
cut beef into small bits, and fill a junk bottle with it, stop it up
tight, and immerse it in a kettle of cold water, put it where it will
boil four or five hours. This way is superior to the other, as the
juices of the meat are obtained unmixed with water; a table spoonful of
this is as nourishing as a cup full of that which is made by broiling.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-10" id="hint-10">10.</a> <i>Carrageen or Irish Moss.</i></h3>

<p>American, or Irish Carrageen, is a very nutritious and light article of
food for children, and invalids, and is a good thickener of milk and
broths, and for blanc mange is equal to the most expensive ingredients,
while the cost is very trifling. The following decoction for consumptive
patients, is recommended. Steep half an ounce of the moss in cold water,
for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> minutes, then take it out, boil it in a quart of milk until
it attains the consistency of warm jelly, strain it, and sweeten it to
the taste, with white sugar or honey, flavor it with whatever spice is
most agreeable, if milk is disagreeable, water may be substituted. If a
tea spoonful of the tincture of rhutany is mixed with a cup full of the
decoction, a tone will be given to the stomach, at the same time that
nourishment is conveyed to the system.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-11" id="hint-11">11.</a> <i>Moss Blanc Mange.</i></h3>

<p>Steep half an ounce of Irish moss in a pint and a half of milk; when it
becomes a thick jelly sweeten it with loaf sugar, and flavor it with
white wine and cinnamon. To make orange, lemon or savory jellies, use a
similar process, substituting water for milk. Jellies made of it, are
more nourishing, than those made of sago, tapioca or arrow root.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-12" id="hint-12">12.</a> <i>Elderberry Syrup.</i></h3>

<p>Wash and strain the berries, which should be perfectly ripe, to a pint
of the juice put a pint of molasses. Boil it twenty minutes, stirring it
constantly; then take it from the fire, and when cold add to each quart
four table spoonsful of brandy; bottle and cork it. This is an excellent
remedy for a tight cough.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-13" id="hint-13">13.</a> <i>New Bread and Cake from old and rusked bread.</i></h3>

<p>Bread that is several days old, may be renewed by putting it into a
steamer, and steaming it from half to three quarters of an hour,
according to its size; the steamer should not be more than half full,
otherwise the water will boil up on to the bread. When steamed, wrap it
up loosely in a dry cloth, and let it remain till quite dry, it will
then appear like bread just baked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> If pieces of bread are put in the
oven and dried, several hours after baking in it, they will keep good a
long time. They are good as fresh bread for dressing to meat, and for
puddings, if soaked soft in cold water. Rich cake with wine or brandy in
it, will keep good several months in winter, if kept in a cool place.
The day it is to be eaten, it should be put in a tin pan, and set in a
bake pan that has a tea cup of water in it, when heated thoroughly
through take it up.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-14" id="hint-14">14.</a> <i>To Preserve Cheese from Insects and Mould.</i></h3>

<p>Cover the cheese while whole with a paste made of wheat flour, put a
piece of paper or cloth over it, and cover it with the paste, keep it in
a cool dry place. Cheese that has skippers in it, if kept till cold
weather will be free from them. Cheese that is growing mouldy can be
prevented from becoming any more so, by grating it fine and moistening
it with wine, and covering it up in a jar. It is preferred by many
people to that which is not grated.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-15" id="hint-15">15.</a> <i>To keep Vegetables and Herbs.</i></h3>

<p>Succulent vegetables, are preserved best in a cool shady place that is
damp. Turnips, potatoes, and similar vegetables should be protected from
the air and frost, by being buried in earth; in very severe cold
weather, they should be covered with a linen cloth. It is said that the
dust of charcoal will keep potatoes from sprouting, if sprinkled over
them.&mdash;Herbs should be gathered on a dry day, either just before or
while in blossom; they should be tied in bundles and hung in a shady
airy place, with the blossoms downwards. When perfectly dry, put away
the medicinal ones in bundles; pick off the leaves of those that are to
be used in cooking, pound and sift them, and keep them in bottles corked
tight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-16" id="hint-16">16.</a> <i>To preserve various kinds of Fruit over winter.</i></h3>

<p>Apples can be kept till June, by taking only those that are perfectly
sound, and wiping them dry, and putting them in barrels with a layer of
bran to each layer of apples. Cover the barrel with a linen cloth to
protect them from the frost. Mortar put on the top of the apples, is
said to be an excellent thing to prevent their decaying, as it draws the
air from them, which is the principal cause of decay; the mortar should
not touch the apples. To preserve oranges and lemons for several months,
take those that are perfectly fresh, and wrap each one by itself in soft
paper, and put them in glass jars, or a very tight box, strew white sand
thickly round each one and over the top. The sand should be previously
perfectly dried in the oven, several hours after baking in it. Cover the
fruit up tight, and keep it in a cool dry place, but not so cold as to
freeze it. To preserve grapes gather them on a dry day, when not quite
dead ripe; pick those off from the stem, that are not perfectly fair,
lay them in a glass jar and on each layer sprinkle a layer of dry bran,
taking care that none of the grapes touch each other, have a layer of
bran on the top of them, and cork and seal them tight. A box will do to
keep them in if covered with mortar. To restore them to their freshness
when they are to be eaten, cut the ends of the stalks and immerse them
in wine, let them remain in it for a few moments before they are to be
eaten. Various kinds of green fruit, such as grapes, currants,
gooseberries and plums, can be kept the year round by putting them in
bottles, and setting them in an oven four or five hours after baking in
it; let them remain in it till they begin to shrink, then cork and seal
them tight, they will be fit for pies, whenever you wish to use them.
Ripe blackberries, and whortleberries, dried perfectly in the sun, and
tied up in bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> so as to exclude the air, will keep good over the
winter. Whenever you wish to use them for pies, pour on boiling water
enough to cover them, and let them remain in it till they swell to
nearly the original size, then drain off the water, and use them.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-17" id="hint-17">17.</a> <i>To extract essences from various kinds of flowers.</i></h3>

<p>Procure a quantity of the petals of any kind of flowers that have an
agreeable fragrance. Card thin layers of cotton, which dip into the
finest Florence oil. Sprinkle a small quantity of salt on the flowers,
and put a layer of them in a glass jar or wide mouthed bottle, with a
layer of the cotton, put in a layer of each alternately until the jar is
full, then cover the top up tight with a bladder. Place the vessel in a
south window, exposed to the heat of the sun. In the course of a
fortnight, a fragrant oil may be squeezed from the cotton, little
inferior if rose leaves are made use of, to the imported otto of rose.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-18" id="hint-18">18.</a> <i>Indelible Ink for marking linen.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve a drachm of lunar caustic, in half an ounce of pure cold water.
Dip whatever is to be marked in pearlash water, dry it perfectly, then
rub it smooth with a silver spoon, (ironing it sets the pearlash water,)
write on it, and place it in the sun, and let it remain until the name
appears plain and black. Red ink for marking linen, is made by mixing
and reducing to a fine powder, half an ounce of vermilion, a drachm of
the salt of steel, and linseed oil enough to render it of the
consistency of black durable ink.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-19" id="hint-19">19.</a> <i>Perfume Bags.</i></h3>

<p>Rose leaves dried in the shade, and mixed with powdered cloves, cinnamon
and mace, put in small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> bags and pressed, is a fine thing to keep in
drawers of linen, to perfume them.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-20" id="hint-20">20.</a> <i>Lip Salve.</i></h3>

<p>Dissolve a small lump of white sugar, in a table spoonful of rose water,
clear water will do but is not as good. Mix it with a table spoonful of
sweet oil, a piece of spermaceti of the size of half a butternut. Simmer
the whole together about eight or ten minutes.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-21" id="hint-21">21.</a> <i>Bread Seals.</i></h3>

<p>Take the crust of newly baked bread, moisten it with gum water and milk,
add either vermilion in powder or rose pink, to color it. When moistened
work it with the fingers till it forms a consistent paste without
cracking; it should then be laid in a cellar, till the next day. Then
break it into pieces of the size you wish to have the seals, warm and
roll them into balls, press one at a time, on the warm impression of a
seal press. The bread should go into every part of the sealing wax
impression; while the bread remains on it, pinch the upper part so as to
form a handle, to hold the bread seal when in use. Take off the bread
seal, trim all the superfluous parts, put the seals where they will dry
slowly. The more the bread has been worked with the fingers, the more
glossy and smooth will be the seals, and the better impression will they
make.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-22" id="hint-22">22.</a> <i>To loosen the Glass Stopples of Decanters or Smelling Bottles when
wedged in tight.</i></h3>

<p>Rub a drop or two of oil with a feather round the stopple, close to the
mouth of the bottle or decanter, then place it between one and two feet
from the fire. The heat will cause the oil to run down between the
stopple and mouth. When warm strike it gently on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> both sides with any
light wooden instrument, you may happen to have; then try to loosen it
with the hand. If it will not move, repeat the process of rubbing oil on
it, and warming it. By persevering in this method, you will at length
succeed in loosening it, however firmly it may be wedged in.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-23" id="hint-23">23.</a> <i>Cement for broken China, Glass and Earthenware.</i></h3>

<p>To half a pint of skimmed milk, add an equal quantity of vinegar to
curdle it, then separate the curd from the whey, and mix the curd with
the whites of five eggs, beat the whole well together, then add enough
of the finest quicklime to form a consistent paste. (Plaster of Paris is
still better if it can be procured, than lime.) Rub this mixture on the
broken edges of the china or glass, match the pieces and bind them
tightly together, and let them remain bound several weeks. They will
then be as firm as if never broken. Boiling crockery in milk is a good
thing to cement them, the pieces should be matched, bound with pieces of
cloth, and boiled half an hour, they should remain in the milk till
cold, and not be used for several weeks. Pulverized quicklime mixed with
the white of an egg and rubbed in the cracks of china and glass, will
prevent their coming apart; the dishes should be bound firmly for
several weeks, after it is rubbed in. The Chinese method of mending
broken china, is to grind flint glass, on a painter's stone, as fine as
possible, and then beat it, with the white of an egg to a froth, and lay
it on the edges of the broken pieces. It should remain bound several
weeks. It is said, that no art will then be able to break it in the same
place.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-24" id="hint-24">24.</a> <i>Japanese Cement or Rice Glue.</i></h3>

<p>Mix rice flour intimately with cold water, and then gently boil it. It
answers all the purposes of wheat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> flour paste, and is far superior in
point of transparency and smoothness. This composition made with a
comparatively small proportion of water, that it may have the
consistence of plastic clay, will form models, busts, statues, basso
relievos and similar articles. The Japanese make fish of it which very
much resemble those made of mother of pearl. Articles made of it when
dry are susceptible of a very high polish. Poland starch, is a very nice
cement, for pasting layers of paper together, and any fancy articles
when it is necessary.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-25" id="hint-25">25.</a> <i>Cement for Alabaster.</i></h3>

<p>Take of bees' wax one pound, of rosin half a pound, and three quarters
of a pound of alabaster. Melt the wax and rosin, then strew the
alabaster, previously reduced to a fine powder, over in it lightly. Stir
the whole well together, then knead the mass in water, in order to
incorporate the powder thoroughly with the rosin and wax. Heat the
cement and the alabaster, which should be perfectly dry, when applied
join and keep it bound a week. This composition when properly managed
forms an extremely strong cement.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-26" id="hint-26">26.</a> <i>To Extract Fruit Stains.</i></h3>

<p>Hold the spot over steam till quite moist, then over burning sulphur;
the sulphurous gas will cause the spot to disappear.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-27" id="hint-27">27.</a> <i>To extract spots of paint from Silk, Woolen and Cotton Goods.</i></h3>

<p>Saturate the spots with spirits of turpentine, let it remain several
hours, then take the cloth and rub it between the hands. It will crumble
away and not injure either the texture or color of the cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-28" id="hint-28">28.</a> <i>To remove black stains on Scarlet Merinos or Broadcloths.</i></h3>

<p>Wash the stain in water with a little tartaric acid in it, rinse it
directly, and care should be taken not to get any of the acid water on
the clean part of the dress. Weak pearlash water is good to remove
stains produced by acids.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-29" id="hint-29">29.</a> <i>To remove grease spots from Paper, Silk or Woolen.</i></h3>

<p>Grate on chalk enough to cover the grease spots. French chalk is the
best, but common chalk will answer very well. Cover the spots with brown
paper, and set a warm flat iron on the top, and let it remain until
cold. Care must be taken not to get the iron so hot as to change the
color of the article. If the grease does not appear to be extracted, on
removing the flat iron, grate on more chalk, and heat the iron, and put
it on again.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-30" id="hint-30">30.</a> <i>To extract stains from white Cotton goods and Colored Silks.</i></h3>

<p>Spots of common or durable ink, can be removed by saturating them with
lemon juice and salt in summer, and keeping them where the sun will
shine on them several hours. Rub the juice and salt on them as fast as
they get dry. Where lemons cannot be procured, tartaric acid dissolved
in salt and water, is a good substitute. Iron mould can be removed in
the same way; it is said that spirits of salts diluted with water will
also extract iron mould. Sal ammoniac with lime, will take out the
stains of wine. Mildew and most other stains on white goods, can be
removed by rubbing on soft soap and salt, and putting them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> a hot
summer's sun, it should be rubbed on as fast as it dries. Where this
fails, lemon juice and salt will be generally effectual. Colored cotton
goods that have ink spilt on them, should be soaked in lukewarm milk or
vinegar; sour milk is the best. Spirits of turpentine, alcohol or sal
ammoniac, are all good to remove spots from colored silks.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-31" id="hint-31">31.</a> <i>Rules for washing Calicoes.</i></h3>

<p>Calicoes that incline to fade, can have the colors set by washing them
with beef's gall in clear water previous to washing them in soap suds; a
small tea cup full to a pail of water is the right proportion. By
squeezing out the gall, and bottling and corking it up, it can be kept
several months. A little vinegar in the rinsing water of calicoes, that
have green, pink or red colors, will brighten them and prevent their
mixing together. Yellow calicoes should be washed in soap suds and not
rinsed. A little salt in the rinsing water of calicoes, particularly
blues and greens, tends to prevent their fading by subsequent washing,
it will also prevent their catching fire readily. Thin starch water is
good to wash fading calicoes in, but it is rather hard to get them clean
in it; no soap is necessary. Calicoes should not be washed in very hot
suds and soft soap should never be used, excepting for buff and yellows,
for which it is the best. The two latter colors should not be rinsed in
clear water.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-32" id="hint-32">32.</a> <i>Rules for washing Silks.</i></h3>

<p>The water in which pared potatoes has been boiled, is an excellent thing
to wash black silk in, it makes it look almost as black and glossy as
new. Beef's gall in soap suds is also very good, and soap suds without
the gall does very well. Colored silks should have all the spots removed
before the whole of the article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> is wet. Put soap into boiling water and
beat it till it is all dissolved, and forms a strong lather when at a
hand heat, put in the article that is to be washed and if strong it may
be rubbed hard; when clean squeeze out the water without wringing, and
rinse it in warm water. Rinse it in another water and for bright
yellows, crimsons, maroons and scarlets, put in oil of vitriol,
sufficient to give the water an acid taste, for oranges, fawns, browns
or their shades use no acids, for pinks, rose colors, and their shades,
use tartaric acid, lemon juice or vinegar. For bright scarlet, use a
solution of tin. For blues, purples, and their shades, add a small
quantity of American pearlash, to restore the colors. Verdigris
dissolved in the rinsing water of olive greens is good to revive the
colors, a solution of copper is also good. Dip the silks up and down in
the rinsing water, and take them out without wringing, and before they
get perfectly dry fold them up tight and let them lay a few moments,
then mangle them, if you have not a mangler, iron them on the wrong
side. A little isinglass, dissolved in the rinsing water of blondes and
gauzes, is good to stiffen them.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-33" id="hint-33">33.</a> <i>Rules for washing Woolens.</i></h3>

<p>If you do not wish flannels to shrink, wash them in two good suds, made
of hard soap, then wring them out, and pour boiling water on them, and
let them remain in it till cold. A little indigo in the rinsing water of
white flannels makes them look nicer. If you wish to shrink your
flannels, wash them in suds made of soft soap, and rinse them in cold
water. Colored woolens that incline to fade, should be washed with a
little beef's gall in the suds. Cloth pantaloons look well washed with
beef's gall in the suds; they should be pressed, when quite damp, on the
wrong side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-34" id="hint-34">34.</a> <i>Rules for washing white Cotton Clothes.</i></h3>

<p>Table cloths that have coffee or any other stains on them, should have
boiling water turned on them and remain in it till cold. The spots
should be rubbed out before they are put in soap suds, or they will be
set, so that they cannot be removed by subsequent washing. If a little
starch is put in the rinsing water, the stains will come out more easily
the next time they are washed. Any white cloths, that have fruit stains
on them, should be washed in the same manner. It is a good plan, to soap
and soak very dirty clothes over night; put them in when the water is
lukewarm, and let them heat gradually, if they get to boiling it will
not do any harm. Where rain water cannot be procured to wash with, a
little lye in the proportion of half a pailful to seven or eight pails
of hard water will soften it so that much less soap will be necessary.
It is said that white clothes washed in the following manner will not
need any rubbing. To five gallons of soft water, add half a gallon of
lime water, a pint and a half of soap and a couple of ounces of the
salts of soda. Wet the clothes thoroughly and soak the parts that are
most soiled; if very dirty, they should be soaked over night. Heat the
above mixture boiling hot, then put in the clothes, let them boil an
hour, then drain and rinse them thoroughly in warm water, then in indigo
water, and they are fit for drying. The soda can be procured cheap, by
purchasing it in large quantities. It is a good plan to save the dirty
suds after washing, to water your garden if you have one, it is also
good to harden sandy cellars and yards.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-35" id="hint-35">35.</a> <i>To clean Silk and Woolen Shawls.</i></h3>

<p>Pare and grate raw potatoes, put a pint of it in two quarts of clear
water. Let it stand for five hours, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> strain the water and rub
through as much of the potatoe as possible; let it remain until
perfectly clear, then turn off the water carefully. Put a clean white
cloth on a table, lay the shawl on it and pin it down tight. Dip a clean
sponge into the potatoe water and rub the shawl with it till clean, then
rinse the shawl in clear water. When nearly dry, mangle it; if you have
not a mangler, wrap it up in a clean white cloth and press it under a
heavy weight till perfectly dry. All the grease spots and stains should
be taken out of the shawls, before they are washed with the potatoe
water.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-36" id="hint-36">36.</a> <i>To clean Silk Stockings.</i></h3>

<p>Wash the stockings in mildly warm hard soap suds, rinse them in soap
suds and if you wish to have them of a flesh color, put in a little
rose, pink or cochineal powder; if you prefer a bluish cast, put in a
little indigo. Hang them up to dry without wringing, when nearly dry,
iron them on the right side, till perfectly so. If you wish silks of any
kind to have a gloss on them, never rinse them without soap in the
water.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-37" id="hint-37">37.</a> <i>To clean Carpets.</i></h3>

<p>Carpets should be taken up as often as once a year, even if not much
used, as there is danger of their getting moth eaten. If used much they
should be taken up two or three times a year. If there is any appearance
of moths when carpets are taken up, sprinkle a little black pepper or
tobacco on the floor before the carpets are put down. Shake the dust out
of the carpets, and if they are so much soiled as to require cleaning,
rub a little dry magnesia or grated raw potatoes on them; the potatoes
should be rubbed on with a new broom. Let it remain until perfectly dry
before walking on it. If there are any grease or oil spots on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> the
carpet, they should be extracted before the potatoe is rubbed on. They
can be extracted by grating on potter's clay, covering it with brown
paper and a moderately warm flat iron or warming pan. It will be
necessary to do it several times to get out the whole of the grease.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-38" id="hint-38">38.</a> <i>To clean Feather Beds and Mattresses.</i></h3>

<p>When feather beds become soiled or heavy, rub them over with a brush
dipped into hot suds. When clean lay them on a shed or railing, where
the rain will fall on them till they get thoroughly soaked, let them dry
in a hot sun for a week, shaking and turning them over each day. This
way of washing the beds makes the feathers fresh and light, and is much
easier than the old fashioned way of emptying the beds, and washing the
ticking and feathers separately, while it answers quite as well. Hair
mattresses that have become hard and dirty, can be made nearly as good
as new ones, by ripping them and washing the ticking, picking the hair
free from bunches, and keeping it in an airy place several days. When
the ticking gets dry fill it lightly, and tack it together.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-39" id="hint-39">39.</a> <i>To clean Light Kid Gloves.</i></h3>

<p>Magnesia, moist bread and India Rubber, are all of them good to clean
light kid gloves, if rubbed on thoroughly.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-40" id="hint-40">40.</a> <i>To remove Ink or Grease spots from Floors.</i></h3>

<p>Ink spots can be removed by scouring them with sand, wet with water that
has a few drops of oil of vitriol in it. Great care is necessary in
using it, as it eats holes if suffered to remain long without having
something put on to counteract its effects. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> rubbed on floors, it
should be rinsed off immediately with weak pearlash water. Oil and
grease spots can be removed by grating on potter's clay thick and
wetting it, it should remain on till it has absorbed all the grease; if
brown paper and a warm iron is put on, it will come out much quicker.
Pearlash water and sand is also good to extract grease and oil, they
should be rubbed hard, then rinsed directly.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-41" id="hint-41">41.</a> <i>To clean Mahogany and Marble Furniture.</i></h3>

<p>They should be washed in water without any <a name="corr19" id="corr19"></a>soap. A little oil
rubbed on them occasionally gives them a fine polish. White spots on
varnished furniture can be removed by rubbing them with a warm flannel
cloth dipped in spirits of turpentine. It is said that ink spots can be
extracted by rubbing them with blotting paper rolled up tight.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-42" id="hint-42">42.</a> <i>To clean Stone Hearths and Stoves.</i></h3>

<p>If you wish to preserve the original color of free stone hearths, wash
them in clear water, then rub them with a stone of the same kind pounded
fine, let it remain until dry, then rub it off. If the hearths are
stained, rub them hard with a free stone. Hot soft soap or soap suds,
does very well to wash hearths in, provided you have no objections to
their looking dark. For brick hearths use redding mixed with thin starch
and milk. Varnished stoves should have several coats of varnish put on
in summer so as to get quite hard before being used. They should be
washed in warm water without any soap, a little oil rubbed on once or
twice a week, improves the looks of them. Black lead is good to black
stoves that have never been varnished, but it will not do where they
have been. It should be rubbed on dry once or twice a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-43" id="hint-43">43.</a> <i>To clean Brass.</i></h3>

<p>Rotten stone and spirit, is better than any thing else to clean brasses
with. Acids make them look nice at first, but they will not remain clean
long, they are also apt to spot without a great deal of care is used.
When brass andirons are not in use, they should be thoroughly cleaned
with rotten stone, and rubbed over with oil, and wrapped up tight.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-44" id="hint-44">44.</a> <i>To cleanse Vials and Pie Plates.</i></h3>

<p>Bottles and vials, that have had medicine in them, can be cleaned, by
putting a tea spoonful or two of ashes in them and immersing them in
cold water, the water should then be heated gradually until it boils.
When they have boiled about half an hour, take them from the fire, and
let them cool gradually in the water. Pie plates that have been baked on
many times, are apt to impart an unpleasant taste to pies. It may be
remedied by boiling them in ashes and water.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-45" id="hint-45">45.</a> <i>Cautions relative to Brass and Copper.</i></h3>

<p>Cleanliness has been aptly styled the cardinal virtue of cooks; food is
not only more palatable cooked in a cleanly manner, but it is also more
healthy. Many lives have been lost in consequence of carelessness in
using copper, brass and glazed earthen utensils. No oily or acid
substance should be allowed to cool or stand in them. Brass and copper
utensils should be thoroughly cleaned with salt and hot vinegar before
being used.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-46" id="hint-46">46.</a> <i>To keep Pickles and Sweet Meats.</i></h3>

<p>Pickles should be kept in kegs or unglazed earthen jars. Sweetmeats keep
best in glass jars, unglazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> earthen jars do very well. If the jar is
covered with a paper wet in spirits, the sweet meats are less liable to
ferment. Both pickles and sweet meats, should be looked to occasionally
to see that they are not fermenting, if so, the vinegar or syrup should
be turned from them and scalded. If pickles grow soft, it is owing to
the vinegar's not being strong enough; to make it stronger, scald it and
put in a paper wet with molasses, and a little alum.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-47" id="hint-47">47.</a> <i>Starch.</i></h3>

<p>To make good flour starch, mix the flour with a little water till free
from lumps, thin it gradually with more water, then stir it slowly into
boiling water. Let it boil five or six minutes stirring it frequently, a
tallow candle stirred round in it several times makes it smoother.
Strain it through a thick bag. Starch made in this manner will be free
from lumps, and answers for cotton and linen as well as Poland starch.
Many people like it for muslins. Poland starch is made in the same
manner as flour starch. When rice is boiled in a pot without a bag, the
water that it is boiled in is as good as Poland starch for clearing
muslins, if boiled by itself a few moments and strained. Muslins to look
very clear, should be starched and clapped while the starch is hot.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-48" id="hint-48">48.</a> <i>To temper New Ovens and Iron Ware.</i></h3>

<p>New ovens before being used, to retain their heat well, should be heated
half a day. The lid should be put up as soon as the wood is taken out.
It should not be used to bake in the first time it is heated. Iron
utensils are less liable to crack if heated gradually before they are
used. New flat irons should be heated half a day, to retain their heat
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-49" id="hint-49">49.</a> <i>To temper Earthen Ware.</i></h3>

<p>Earthen ware that is used to cook in, is less liable to crack from the
heat, by being put before they are used into cold water and heated
gradually till the water boils, then taken from the fire and left in the
water until cold.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-50" id="hint-50">50.</a> <i>Preservatives against the Ravages of Moths.</i></h3>

<p>To prevent woolen and fur articles of dress, from getting moth eaten
when you have done wearing them, put them in a chest with cedar chips,
camphor gum or tobacco leaves.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-51" id="hint-51">51.</a> <i>To drive away various kinds of Household Vermin.</i></h3>

<p>A little quicksilver and white of an egg beat together and put in the
crevices of bedsteads, with a feather, is the most effectual bed bug
poison. A solution of vitriol is also a good thing rubbed on walls that
are infested by them. Hellebore with molasses rubbed on it, is an
excellent thing to kill cockroaches, and put round the places that they
are in the habit of frequenting. Arsenic spread on bread and butter, and
placed round in rat holes, will put a stop to their ravages very
speedily. Great care is necessary in using all these poisons where there
are children, as they are equally as fatal to human beings as vermin.
The flower of sulphur sprinkled round places that ants frequent, will
drive them away. Half a tea spoonful of black pepper, one of sugar and a
table spoonful of cream mixed and kept on a plate, in a room where flies
are troublesome will soon cause them to disappear. Weak brine will kill
worms in gravel walks. They should be kept moist with it a week, in the
spring, and three or four days in the fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-52" id="hint-52">52.</a> <i>To keep Meat in hot Weather.</i></h3>

<p>Cover it with bran, and keep it where there is a free circulation of
air, away from the flies. A wire safe is an excellent thing to preserve
meat from spoiling.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-53" id="hint-53">53.</a> <i>To Prevent polished Cutlery from rusting.</i></h3>

<p>Knives, snuffers and other steel articles, are apt to rust when not
cleaned frequently. To prevent it wrap them tight in coarse brown paper,
when not in use. Knives and forks should be perfectly free from spots
and well polished when not in use. They should also be wrapped up, each
one by itself, so as to exclude the air.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-54" id="hint-54">54.</a> <i>To melt Fat for Shortening.</i></h3>

<p>The fat of all kinds of meat, excepting mutton and hams, makes good
shortening. Roast meat drippings and the liquor that meat is boiled in,
should stand until cold to have the fat harden so that it can be taken
off easily. Cut your scraps of fat into small pieces, and melt them
slowly without burning, together with the fat from your drippings. When
melted, strain it and let it remain until nearly cold, then pour in a
little cold water. When the fat forms into a hard cake, take it up and
scrape off the sediment that adheres to the under side, melt it again
and when lukewarm sprinkle in a little salt. The dregs of fat are good
for soap grease. This shortening answers all the various purposes of
lard very well, excepting in the warmest weather. In using it for pies
it is necessary to use considerable butter with it. The fat of meat
should not be suffered to lie more than a week in winter without
melting, and in summer not more than two or three days. Mutton fat and
the fat of beef, if melted into hard cakes, will fetch a good price at
the tallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> chandler's. It is much more economical for housekeepers to
put down their own pork, than to buy it already salted. The leaves and
thin pieces that are not good for salting, should be cut into small bits
and melted, then strained through a cullender with a cloth laid in it,
as soon as it begins to thicken sprinkle in a tea cup of salt, to twenty
or thirty weight of the lard; stir it in well, then set it away in a
cool place. Some people have an idea that pork scraps must be fried till
very brown in order to be preserved good the year round, but it is not
necessary if salt is put in.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-55" id="hint-55">55.</a> <i>To preserve Eggs fresh a Year.</i></h3>

<p>Mix a handful of unslacked lime with the same quantity of salt, two or
three gallons of water. If eggs that are perfectly fresh are put in this
mixture, they will keep good a year in it, provided none are cracked.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-56" id="hint-56">56.</a> <i>To preserve Cream for long Voyages.</i></h3>

<p>Take cream that is fresh and rich, and mix it with half its weight of
powdered white sugar, stir the whole well together, and preserve it in
bottles corked very tight. In this state it is ready to mix with tea and
coffee.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-57" id="hint-57">57.</a> <i>Substitute for Milk and Cream in Tea or Coffee.</i></h3>

<p>Beat the white of a fresh egg in a bowl, and turn on to it gradually
boiling tea or coffee. It is difficult to distinguish the taste from
rich cream.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-58" id="hint-58">58.</a> <i>To Cure Butter.</i></h3>

<p>Take two parts of the best common salt, one part of sugar and one of
saltpetre, blend the whole well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> together. Mix one ounce of this
composition well with every sixteen ounces of the butter. Close it up
tight in kegs, cover it with an oiled paper, and let it remain untouched
for a month. Butter cured in this manner is very nice, and will keep
good eight or nine months, if not exposed to the air.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-59" id="hint-59">59.</a> <i>To make salt Butter Fresh.</i></h3>

<p>Put four pounds of salt butter into a churn, with four quarts of new
milk and a small portion of annatto. Churn them together, take out the
butter in the course of an hour, and treat it like fresh butter, working
in the usual quantity of salt; a little white sugar improves it. This is
said to be equal to fresh butter in every respect. The salt may be got
out of a small quantity at a time, by working it over in fresh water,
changing the water several times.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-60" id="hint-60">60.</a> <i>To take Rankness from a small quantity of Butter.</i></h3>

<p>Take a quantity that is to be made use of, put it into a bowl filled
with boiling water with a little saleratus in it, let it remain until
cold, then take it off carefully and work it over with a little salt. By
this method it is separated from the grosser particles.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-61" id="hint-61">61.</a> <i>Windsor Soap.</i></h3>

<p>To make this celebrated soap for shaving and washing the hands, nothing
more is necessary than to slice the best white soap as thin as possible
and melt it over a slow fire. When melted take it up, when lukewarm
scent it with the oil of caraway or any other oil that is more
agreeable, then turn it into moulds and let it remain in a dry situation
several days. It will then be fit for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-62" id="hint-62">62.</a> <i>To make Bayberry or Myrtle Soap.</i></h3>

<p>To a pound of bayberry tallow, put a pint of potash lye, strong enough
to bear up an egg. Boil them together till it becomes soap. Then put in
half a tea cup of cold water, let it boil several minutes longer. Take
it off, and when partly cooled put in a few drops of the essence of
wintergreen, pour it into moulds and let it remain several days. This
soap is good for shaving, and is an excellent thing for chapped hands
and eruptions on the face.</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="hint-63" id="hint-63">63.</a> <i>Cold Soap.</i></h3>

<p>To twenty pounds of white potash put ten of grease, previously melted
and strained. Mix it well together with a pailful of cold water, let it
remain several days, then stir in several more pailsful of cold water.
Continue to pour in cold water at intervals of two or three days,
stirring it up well each time. As soon as the water begins to thin it,
it is time to leave off adding it. This method of making soap is much
easier than any other, while it is equally cheap and good. If you have
not land to enrich with your ashes they can be disposed of to advantage
at the soap boiler's.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
